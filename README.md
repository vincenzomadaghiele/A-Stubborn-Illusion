#### Authors: Andrea Pagliara, Elisa Lombardo & Vincenzo Madaghiele 
#### Audiovisual piece for flute, live electronics and generative visuals


### Work description

The work unfolds as a dialogue between the acoustic musical material and a computational visual system, metaphorical actors of this work. 
The audiovisual elements of the piece navigate and explore the potential of a system that emerges from the relationship between audio and video, unveiling its acoustic-digital life, its points of fracture and growth. 
The electro-acoustic sonic components develop on a rhythmic counterpoint, evolving in discrepancy and disorder throughout the piece. Acoustic sounds flow through the digital simulation, distorting shapes towards the tipping points of their equilibrium. 
The single elements are independent, yet entangled. Macro forms arise from their relationships, and complex behaviours that are bigger than the sum of its parts. The acoustic - human - dialogues with the digital - non-human - exploring tensions and beauty of this human-system relationship.
