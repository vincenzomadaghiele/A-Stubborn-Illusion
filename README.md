### Work description

This audiovisual work deals with the concept of non-linearity of time and Entropy. It tries to escape from our usual way of thinking about time as something unidirectional. Time flow is not only relative in the theoretical physics, it is in our psychological perception as well.

The sound elements of acoustic instruments in rhythmic counterpoint are manipulated through electroacoustics processes, to achieve a sense of disorder and discrepancy in the system. The same behaviour is reflected in the graphical side of the work, in which increasing distortions and disturbances influence the movements of a particle system. 

### The work was performed in two alternative versions at:
